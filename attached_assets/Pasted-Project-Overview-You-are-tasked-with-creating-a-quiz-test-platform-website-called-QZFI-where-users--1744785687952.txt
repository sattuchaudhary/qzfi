Project Overview: You are tasked with creating a quiz/test platform website called QZFI where users can take quizzes based on different categories (e.g., Current Affairs, General Knowledge, etc.). Each category will have multiple tests with questions, and users will answer them one at a time. After each question, the system will show if the selected answer was correct or incorrect. The admin panel will allow the admin to manage the website, including adding, deleting, or modifying tests, questions, and categories.

Frontend (User Interface):
Home Page:

Display a list of categories such as Current Affairs, General Knowledge, etc.

Each category will be clickable and will lead to a new page showing the available tests within that category.

Category Page:

Once the user selects a category, show a list of tests available for that category.

Display the test name, the upload date, and a "Start Test" button for each test.

Test Page:

When the user clicks "Start Test", display the first question of the selected test.

Only one question will be shown at a time.

Each question will have multiple options, and the user will select one option.

After selecting the option, show if the answer is correct or incorrect on the same screen.

Provide a "Next" button to proceed to the next question.

Answer Feedback:

Once the user selects an option, show whether the answer is correct or incorrect in a message on the same screen.

After the user clicks "Next", the next question appears.

Backend (Admin Panel):
Admin Panel:

The admin panel will allow the website administrator to manage categories, tests, and questions.

Admin should be able to:

Add a new category, test, or question.

Delete categories, tests, or questions.

Modify existing categories, tests, and questions.

Manage Categories:

Admin can add new categories (e.g., Current Affairs, General Knowledge).

Admin can delete or modify existing categories.

Manage Tests:

Admin can add tests to a category, specify the test name, and upload date.

Admin can delete or modify tests.

Manage Questions:

Admin can add, delete, or modify questions for each test.

Admin can specify the correct answer for each question.

Database:

A database will be used to store information related to categories, tests, questions, and user progress.

The database will store the user's answers to check if they are correct, and track which question the user is on.
